# Some-stuff-written-in-R

Algorithms for One and Two Sample Mean hypothesis testing using R in R-studio. 
NOTE: these programs work correctly but they are not finished. Each should ideally be implemented by passing values for spreadsheet file(s), null hypothesis, and alternative hypothesis as parameters to a function. 

What do these programs do? Only the results of the calculations are printed to the console without any snippets of code. This is done so the results are easily read by human eyes (no confusing code to filter through). 

NOTE: datasets must be imported into R-studio so that the code runs correctly.
