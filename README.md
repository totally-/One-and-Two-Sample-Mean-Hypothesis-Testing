# Some-stuff-written-in-R

Here are two algorithms for One and Two Sample Mean hypothesis testing using R in R-studio. 
NOTE: these programs work correctly but they could, and should, be implemented by passing values for spreadsheet file(s), null hypothesis, and alternative hypothesis as parameters to a function. In other words, these programs can be written into functions. 

What do these programs do? Only the results of the calculations are printed to the console without any snippets of code. This is done so the results are easily read by human eyes without any confusing code to filter through. 

NOTE: datasets must be imported into R-studio so that the code runs correctly.
